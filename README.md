# hg612

This will be a collection of scripts for the Huawei HG612.

You need to have unlocked it and restore the full HG612
firmware in order to use these.

At the moment, there's just a bash script which is a plugin
for munin. See the munin site for information about plugins:
http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/plugins

With big thanks to the people who wrote the unlocking
instructions at http://www.kitz.co.uk/routers/hg612unlock.htm
